# Hi 👋 I'm Janek

### About me
I'm a self-taught front-end developer who is interested in back-end technologies rather than design/UX. I have been learning programming since mid-2018 and was hired by [NetInteractive](https://netinteractive.pl) in March 2019. Recently worked at [Synchtank](https://www.synchtank.com) on web app for royalties management system. I love learning new technologies and solving problems using programming languages. 

🧗‍♂️ Currently working on a social app for arranging sport climbing meetups: [wspin.app](https://wspin.app)

📚 Experienced in **TypeScript**, **React**, **React-Admin**, **Remix (React Router 7)** and **GraphQL**
 
🎲 In my free time, I play board games and practice sport climbing
 
👨‍🎓 Master's degree in Microbiology
